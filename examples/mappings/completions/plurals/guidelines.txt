You should provide labels for texts based on whether or not they contain plural nouns. The labels are as follows:

1. HAS_PLURALS: For sentences containing at least one plural noun.
2. NO_PLURALS: For sentences containing no plural nouns.

Before giving the label, first extract a comma separated list of all the nouns in the text.
